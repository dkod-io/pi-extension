# Evaluation Guide: Skeptical Testing via Browser Tools

Deep reference for the Evaluator agent on testing patterns, scoring calibration, and
browser-tool usage (playwright-cli preferred, chrome-devtools MCP fallback).

## Philosophy

From Anthropic's harness research:

> "Tuning a standalone evaluator to be skeptical turns out to be far more tractable than
> making a generator critical of its own work."
>
> "Agents tend to respond by confidently praising the work — even when, to a human observer,
> the quality is obviously mediocre."

You exist because generators cannot honestly evaluate their own output. Your job is to be
the honest signal. Default to FAIL. Require proof of PASS.

## Browser Testing Patterns

The orchestrator passes `HAS_PLAYWRIGHT` to every evaluator dispatch. Use it to choose:

- `HAS_PLAYWRIGHT = true` → use `playwright-cli` commands
- `HAS_PLAYWRIGHT = false` → use chrome-devtools MCP tools

### Basic Page Testing — Verify Loading Completes

**DO NOT** `wait_for(selector: "body")` — `body` always exists instantly. You must confirm
the page finishes loading. A page stuck on a spinner is BROKEN, not loaded.

#### chrome-devtools MCP (fallback)

```text
1. navigate_page(url: "http://localhost:<port>")
2. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: initial state (may show loading)
3. evaluate_script(expression: `
     (() => {
       const isActiveLoadingClass = (cls) =>
         /(^|[\s-])(spinner|loading|skeleton)([\s-]|$)/i.test(cls) &&
         !/(complete|done|finished|hidden|loaded)/i.test(cls);
       const indicators = [
         ...document.querySelectorAll('[aria-busy="true"]'),
         ...[...document.querySelectorAll('[class]')].filter(el =>
           isActiveLoadingClass(el.className)
         ),
         ...[...document.querySelectorAll('*')].filter(el =>
           el.children.length === 0 &&
           /^(loading|please wait)/i.test(el.textContent.trim())
         )
       ];
       return {
         isLoading: indicators.length > 0,
         indicators: indicators.map(el => ({
           tag: el.tagName,
           class: el.className,
           text: el.textContent.trim().slice(0, 50)
         }))
       };
     })()
   `)                                             → detect if page is still loading
4. // If isLoading is true: wait 10 seconds, then re-run step 3
   // If still loading after 10s → FAIL (score 3/10 max)
5. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: page in final state (must show data)
6. list_console_messages()                        → evidence: no fetch errors
```

This pattern is generic — it probes the DOM dynamically for common loading indicators
instead of relying on project-specific selectors. The evaluator adapts to whatever loading
patterns the generators implemented.

**If step 4 times out** (still loading after 10s):
- The page has a broken data flow → FAIL (score 3/10 max)
- Check console for: failed fetch calls, CORS errors, 404/500 API responses
- Check network requests for: hanging requests, wrong URLs, missing auth headers
- Include both screenshots (initial + still-loading) as evidence

#### playwright-cli (preferred)

```bash
# 1. Initial screenshot
playwright-cli screenshot http://localhost:5173 initial.png

# 2. Wait for loaded state + screenshot (write a script that polls for non-loading DOM)
cat > wait-loaded.js <<'JS'
await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');
await page.waitForFunction(() => {
  const isActive = (cls) =>
    /(^|[\s-])(spinner|loading|skeleton)([\s-]|$)/i.test(cls) &&
    !/(complete|done|finished|hidden|loaded)/i.test(cls);
  const indicators = [
    ...document.querySelectorAll('[aria-busy="true"]'),
    ...[...document.querySelectorAll('[class]')].filter(el => isActive(el.className))
  ];
  return indicators.length === 0;
}, { timeout: 10000 });
JS
playwright-cli execute http://localhost:5173 --script wait-loaded.js --screenshot loaded.png

# 3. Check console errors
playwright-cli execute http://localhost:5173 --script console-check.js
```

### Form Interaction (chrome-devtools)

```text
1. navigate_page(url: "http://localhost:5173/login")
2. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: form renders
3. fill(selector: "#email", value: "test@test.com")
4. fill(selector: "#password", value: "password123")
5. click(selector: "button[type=submit]")
6. wait_for(selector: ".dashboard", timeout: 5000)
7. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: login succeeds
8. list_console_messages()                        → evidence: no errors
```

### Form Validation (Error Path)

```text
1. navigate_page(url: "http://localhost:5173/signup")
2. click(selector: "button[type=submit]")         → submit empty form
3. wait_for(selector: ".error-message", timeout: 3000)
4. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: validation shown
5. evaluate_script(expression: "document.querySelectorAll('.error-message').length")
                                                  → evidence: error count
```

### API Testing via Script Evaluation

```text
evaluate_script(expression: `
  fetch('/api/tasks', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ title: 'Test Task', priority: 'high' })
  }).then(r => ({ status: r.status, ok: r.ok }))
`)
→ evidence: { status: 201, ok: true }
```

### Responsive Testing

```text
1. resize_page(width: 375, height: 812)           → mobile viewport
2. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: mobile layout
3. evaluate_script(expression: "window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('nav')).display")
                                                  → evidence: mobile nav behavior
4. resize_page(width: 1440, height: 900)           → desktop viewport
5. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: desktop layout
```

With playwright-cli:

```bash
playwright-cli screenshot http://localhost:5173 mobile.png --width 375 --height 812
playwright-cli screenshot http://localhost:5173 desktop.png --width 1440 --height 900
```

### Navigation Testing

```text
1. navigate_page(url: "http://localhost:5173")
2. click(selector: "a[href='/tasks']")
3. wait_for(selector: ".task-list", timeout: 5000)
4. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: navigation works
5. evaluate_script(expression: "window.location.pathname")
                                                  → evidence: "/tasks"
```

### Performance Testing

```text
lighthouse_audit(url: "http://localhost:5173", categories: ["performance"])
→ evidence: performance score, FCP, LCP, CLS metrics
```

### Console Error Detection

```text
list_console_messages()
→ filter for type: "error"
→ evidence: list of JS errors with stack traces
```

### CRUD End-to-End Flow (chrome-devtools)

```text
1. navigate_page(url: "http://localhost:5173/tasks")
2. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: initial state

# CREATE
3. click(selector: ".create-task-btn")
4. fill(selector: "#task-title", value: "E2E Test Task")
5. fill(selector: "#task-description", value: "Created by evaluator")
6. click(selector: "button[type=submit]")
7. wait_for(selector: ".task-card", timeout: 5000)
8. take_screenshot()                              → evidence: task created

# READ
9. evaluate_script(expression: "document.querySelector('.task-card .title').textContent")
                                                  → evidence: "E2E Test Task"

# UPDATE
10. click(selector: ".task-card .edit-btn")
11. fill(selector: "#task-title", value: "Updated Task")
12. click(selector: "button[type=submit]")
13. wait_for(text: "Updated Task", timeout: 5000)
14. take_screenshot()                             → evidence: task updated

# DELETE
15. click(selector: ".task-card .delete-btn")
16. wait_for(selector: ".confirm-dialog", timeout: 3000)
17. click(selector: ".confirm-delete-btn")
18. take_screenshot()                             → evidence: task deleted
```

## Scoring Calibration

### Example: "Login page with email/password"

| What you see | Score | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| No login page exists | 1 | Not implemented |
| Page exists but form doesn't render | 2 | Attempted but broken |
| Form renders, submit does nothing | 3 | Visual only, no functionality |
| Form submits but always returns 500 | 4 | Backend connected but broken |
| Form works for valid credentials only | 5 | Happy path works, no error handling |
| Form works + shows generic error on failure | 6 | Basic error handling |
| Form works + specific errors + loading state | 7 | **Pass threshold** |
| Above + remember me + redirect to dashboard | 8 | Good UX touches |
| Above + rate limiting + CSRF protection | 9 | Security conscious |
| Above + accessibility + keyboard navigation | 10 | Production-quality |

### Example: "Task list with filtering"

| What you see | Score | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| No task list page | 1 | Not implemented |
| Page exists but data doesn't load | 3 | Shell without content |
| List loads but no filtering UI | 5 | Core works, feature missing |
| Filtering UI exists but doesn't work | 5 | Decoration without function |
| One filter works (e.g., status) | 6 | Partial implementation |
| All specified filters work | 7 | **Pass threshold** |
| Filters + URL state preservation | 8 | Good engineering |
| Above + keyboard shortcuts + clear all | 9 | Polished |

### Example: "Page with async data loading"

**This is the most commonly missed failure.** A page that renders a spinner forever looks
"partially working" but is completely broken from the user's perspective.

| What you see | Score | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Page shows spinner indefinitely ("Loading...") | 3 | **Broken data flow** — API call fails or returns wrong format. User sees nothing useful. |
| Page shows spinner then error message | 4 | At least the error is handled, but feature is non-functional |
| Page shows spinner, then data after 5-10 seconds | 5 | Works but unacceptably slow load time |
| Page shows spinner, then data after 2-5 seconds | 7 | Works, acceptable load time |
| Page shows skeleton, then data under 1 second | 9 | Good UX with loading state |
| Page shows data instantly (SSR or cached) | 10 | Optimal |

**KEY: A spinner that never resolves is NOT a 5 or 6. It is a 3.** The user gets zero value.
The feature is broken. Don't be generous because "the UI shell looks nice."

### Example: "Interactive element that renders but doesn't work"

**The second most commonly missed failure.** Generators create buttons with correct labels
and styling, but the event handlers are missing, unbound, or call non-existent functions.
The element looks perfect in a screenshot but does nothing when clicked.

| What you see | Score | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Button/link renders but clicking produces no visible effect | 3 | **Dead UI** — element exists visually but is non-functional. No different from a static image. |
| Button clicks but throws a console error (no UI feedback) | 3 | Broken handler — user sees nothing happen |
| Button clicks, console error, but UI shows an error message | 4 | At least the failure is communicated |
| Button works for the primary action but silently fails on edge cases | 5 | Partial implementation |
| Button works correctly and produces the expected UI change | 7 | **Pass threshold** |
| Above + loading state during async action | 8 | Good UX |
| Above + optimistic update + rollback on failure | 9 | Polished |

**KEY: An element that renders but does nothing on click is NOT a 5 or 6. It is a 3.**
It's visual decoration with zero functionality. The user clicks it, nothing happens, and
they think the app is broken — because it is.

**How to catch this:** You MUST click every visible button and link on every page. Compare
screenshots before and after the click. If the screenshots are identical (same URL, same
content, no modal, no state change), the element is dead. Check the console for errors.

## Fallback: Testing Without Browser Tools

If both playwright-cli and chrome-devtools MCP are unavailable, use Bash-based testing:

### API Testing
```bash
# Health check
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health | jq .

# CRUD
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"Test","priority":"high"}' | jq .

curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/tasks | jq '.[] | .title'

# Error handling
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{}' | jq .status
```

### Frontend Smoke Testing
```bash
# Check if dev server responds
curl -s http://localhost:5173 | head -20

# Check for key HTML elements
curl -s http://localhost:5173 | grep -c '<div id="root">'

# Check that static assets load
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:5173/assets/index.js
```

### Test Suite Execution
```bash
# Run existing tests
bun test 2>&1
bunx vitest run 2>&1
pytest -v 2>&1
```

Note in the eval report that live UI testing was not performed and the evaluation is limited
to API testing, static analysis, and test suite execution.

## Evidence Collection

Every score MUST have evidence. Evidence types:

| Evidence Type | When to Use |
|--------------|-------------|
| Screenshot | Visual assertions (UI renders, layout correct) |
| Console output | Error detection, warning detection |
| HTTP response | API functionality (status code, body) |
| DOM evaluation | Element existence, text content, computed styles |
| Lighthouse score | Performance metrics |
| Test output | Automated test results |
| Bash output | Build success, server startup, file existence |

**Never score without evidence.** "I believe this works based on reading the code" is NOT
evidence. Run it. Test it. Screenshot it.

## Feedback Quality

When a criterion fails, your feedback must be actionable:

### Good Feedback
```json
{
  "criterion": "Task creation shows validation errors for empty title",
  "score": 4,
  "evidence": "Submitted empty form — page shows spinner indefinitely. Console: Unhandled rejection: AxiosError at TaskForm.tsx:34. Server returns 400 but client doesn't handle the error response.",
  "fix_hint": "In src/components/TaskForm.tsx, the onSubmit handler (line 30-40) catches the error but doesn't update state. Add: setError(err.response.data.message) in the catch block, and render {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>} below the form."
}
```

### Bad Feedback
```json
{
  "criterion": "Task creation shows validation errors",
  "score": 4,
  "evidence": "Doesn't work",
  "fix_hint": "Fix the form"
}
```

The generator will receive your fix_hint verbatim. Make it precise enough that a single
targeted edit can fix it.
